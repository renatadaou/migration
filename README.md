# Ripple Effect of the Syrian Refugee Crisis

In this project, I decided to explore how the Syrian refugee crisis has affected policies across the European Union, especially in regards to humanitarian aid. 

For the websisite, I build a responsive data-driven visualization project that had two columns, where if you make the screen smaller the columns collapse to be on top of one another. I also created two responsive ai2html graphisc that have a mobile and a desktop version.
